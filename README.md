Programming Ground Up for x86-64 architecture

### Info

"Programming Ground Up" (http://nongnu.askapache.com/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf) is a great source for starting out assembler programming. However its code is for x86. This project migrates the programs from this book to x86-64 architecture.


### Troubleshooting

32bit doesn't work on your 64bit machine you might need to install gcc-multilib:

*sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib*
